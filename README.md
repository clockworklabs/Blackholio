# **Blackholio**

**Blackholio** is a small-scoped MMORPG built using Unity and [SpacetimeDB](https://spacetimedb.com), designed to showcase scalable multiplayer game development. Inspired by [agar.io](https://agar.io), **Blackholio** reimagines the mechanics with a space theme where players become planets, stars, and black holes in a competitive cosmic arena.

### **Game Overview**
- **Gameplay:** Absorb smaller entities, grow, evolve, and dominate the leaderboard as a black hole.
- **Scale:** Supports hundreds of players seamlessly with SpacetimeDB's real-time synchronization.
- **Objective:** Demonstrate SpacetimeDB's features and best practices in a fun, interactive project.

## **Tutorial Overview**

This repository accompanies the **Blackholio Unity Tutorial**, which guides you through building the game from scratch while learning:
- **Unity integration** with SpacetimeDB.
- Client-server setup for multiplayer games.
- SpacetimeDB features, including reducers, tables, and scheduled events.

By following the tutorial, you'll develop:
1. A basic understanding of SpacetimeDB for multiplayer games.
2. A functional game prototype with scalable multiplayer features.
